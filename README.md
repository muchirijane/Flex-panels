# Flex-panels
This is simple website creating with Html, Css and Javscript.

The most important part of the whole exerice was to learn how important flex is and can be used to make cards shrink or grow. 
<br>
This is by using flex grow, flex shrink and flex basis or its shorthand flex. eg flex 1 0 auto.

By using translate y, you can make the text animation and later use cubic-bezier for smooth transition. 
<br>
In the javascript section, using eventlistener to add different functions on click or during transition helped a lot.
