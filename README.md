The most important part of the whole exerice was to learn how important flex is and can be used to make cards shrink or grow. 
<br>
This is by using flex grow, flex shrink and flex basis or its shorthand flex. eg flex 1 0 auto. 
<br>
By using translate y, you can make the text animation and later use cubic-bezier for smooth transition. 
<br>
In the javascript section, using eventlistener to add different functions on click or during transition helped a lot.
